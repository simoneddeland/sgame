      Tank Driver is a game showing off the light-weight Javascript game framework SGame. SGame is a framework designed to mimic XNA and MonoGame. The goal of the game is to drive your tank for as long as possible without colliding with any of the rotating obstacles that appear. The tank will drive faster and faster as the game goes along. Control the tank with the WASD or arrow keys.
